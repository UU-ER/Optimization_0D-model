# Project title:
Process-based optimization for material screening using 0D model
# Motivation: 
This algorithm uses process-based optimization approach to screen the materials from large database. 
The process is a Vacuum Temperature Swing Adsorption (VTSA) cycle which is modeled by equilibrium assumption (0D)
# How to setup:
run the file TSEMO_Main.m
# Recommended Citation:
The equilibrium model is affliated to the group of Dr.Matteo Gazzani, Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, Utrecht, Netherlands
The optimization algorithm is TSEMO procedure adapted from the work of @Eric_Bradford
